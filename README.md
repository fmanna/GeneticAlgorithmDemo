# GeneticAlgorithmDemo
 Demo of simple Genetic Algorithms in Python

Based on the Java implementation: https://github.com/memento/GeneticAlgorithm

Which is based on the gist describing a simple Demo: https://gist.github.com/Vini2/bd22b36ddc69c5327097921f5118b709

Which is an implementation of an elegant, graphical demo of Genetic Algorithms: https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
   1. Edit the `Parameters for population` section of `simple)ga_demo.py`'s `main():` function, if desired.
2. Run `python3 simple_ga_demo.py` from the repository directory (Python 3.7.7+ required).
